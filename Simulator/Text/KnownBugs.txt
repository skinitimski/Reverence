!! All of a sudden during a battle the threads will get lost
** I think this one is fixed

!! When you win the battle and restart it, who knows what happens, but it breaks
** Fixed? Hasn't happened in a while!

!! When you arrange the materiatory then immediately do it again, you get caught a different sort order. This bug works mod 3
** Definitely fixed. Sorting is much more specific and it works.





!! When you use an item in battle, its inventory count is not immediately decremented (it waits for the item to be used)
