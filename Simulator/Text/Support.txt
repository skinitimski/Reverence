Materia Name: Counter
Desc: Attacks with paired Command when damage is incurred
HP:    -     Str:  -    Vit:  -    Dex:  -
MP:    -     Mag:  -    Spr:  -    Lck:  -

Lvl  Ability Gained                                      Total AP Req
 1   30% chance of counter with paired Command           0
 2   40% chance of counter with paired Command           20000
 3   60% chance of counter with paired Command           40000
 4   80% chance of counter with paired Command           60000
 5   100% chance of counter with paired Command          100000

Can be paired with:
  Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph, Deathblow, Manipulate, Mime, Master Command
Notes:
  With the exception of Master Command, you will counter once with all the
    abilities you are considered to know that are also on the linked Materia.
    While this seems straightforward for most of them, it is especially
    important with the Throw and Steal Materia.
  Your known ability from any given Throw or Steal Materia will be the one
    highlighted on the materia.  You will be unable to counter with the other
    darkened ability *UNLESS* you have another source for that particular
    ability.  If you have a source for both abilities on the Materia, then
    you will counter with *BOTH*, the higher level ability being used
    immediately after the lower level ability.
  As an example, Counter+Steal L2 (granting Mug) would counter with the Mug
    ability.  However, if you also added a Steal L1 Materia to the character
    so that they theoretically know Steal *AND* Mug at the same time, then
    you will counter *TWICE* when attacked - first with Steal, then with Mug
    - while only needing a single Counter Materia.  However, this will take
    up two of the eight maximum counter effects you may have on a single
    character.
  When linked to Master Command, one of the commands out of Steal, Sense,
    Throw, Morph, D. blow, Manip and Mine will be picked at random to be
    used for a single counter attack.  Coin will never be used as a counter
    from a Master Command linkup, even though Master Command counts as giving
    you Coin, and not Throw.
  Final Attack, Sneak Attack, Counter, Magic Counter and Counter Attack all
    share the same command space, and there are only room for 8 such attacks.
    Only the first eight Counter Effects placed chronologically onto a
    character will be used.
  Support abilities (that naturally target party members) will be used on the
    Countering player or the player's group if the ability is naturally area.
    Attack abilities will be used on the enemy that triggered the counter.


Materia Name: Magic Counter
Desc: Attacks with paired Magic/Summon when attacked
HP:    -     Str:  -    Vit:  -    Dex:  -

 5   100% chance of counter with paired Magic            300000

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia
Notes:
  When linked to normal Magic Materia, the ability countered with will be the
    highest level ability that the current level of the linked Materia can
    bestow.  Linking to normal Summon Materia will simply counter with the
    appropriate summon.
  When linked to Master Magic, any of the 54 possible spells will be picked
    at random to be used to counter attack.
  When linked to Master Summon, any of the 16 possible summons will be picked
    at random to be used to counter attack.
  Support abilities (that naturally target party members) will be used on the
    Countering player or the player's group if the ability is naturally area.
    Attack abilities will be used on the enemy that triggered the counter.
  Final Attack, Sneak Attack, Counter, Magic Counter and Counter Attack all
    share the same command space, and there are only room for 8 such attacks.
    Only the first eight Counter Effects placed chronologically onto a
    character will be used.


Materia Name: MP Turbo
Desc: Uses extra MP and Increases power of paired Magic
HP:    -     Str:  -    Vit:  -    Dex:  -
MP:    -     Mag:  -    Spr:  -    Lck:  -

Lvl  Ability Gained                                      Total AP Req
 1   10% MP Increase, 10% Damage Increase                0
 2   20% MP Increase, 20% Damage Increase                10000
 3   30% MP Increase, 30% Damage Increase                30000
 4   40% MP Increase, 40% Damage Increase                60000
 5   50% MP Increase, 50% Damage Increase                120000

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia
Notes:
  MP Cost = [MP Cost * (10 + MP Turbo Lv) / 10)] + 1
  If (MP Cost > 255) then: MP Cost = 255
  Even if the MP Cost is 255, the Magic Damage Increase will still be the
    full amount the Materia should give.
  Damage Increase is only applied to spells that use the Physical, Magical
    and Cure Formulas.  Spells like Demi will not be affected, but will still
    suffer from the MP Cost Increase.
  Status spells that do not have an automatic 100% chance to hit are also
    affected by MP Turbo, and are multiplied by the same formula damage is
    increased by.
  Multiple MP Turbo Materia can stack on the same spells up to the maximum of
    50% increase - the strength of a single L5 MP Turbo.  MP Turbo Materia
    only gives its effect to abilities that the linked materia can give at
    its *current* level.
  

Materia Name: HP Absorb
Desc: Attacks with paired Materia, absorbs HP at same time
HP:    -     Str:  -    Vit:  -    Dex:  -

 2   --                                                  100000

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia, Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph, Deathblow,
  Manipulate, Mime, Master Command
Notes:
  HP Absorb will restore [Damage / 10] HP when the ability it is enhancing is
    used.  If the ability healed its target, then HP Absorb will hurt you
    instead.
  When linked to Magic and Summon Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to all abilities granted by that materia.  In the case of Magic
    Materia, this is dependent on the Magic Materia's current level.
  When linked with normal Command Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to the highlighted ability on the materia.  The darkened ability
    will only be allowed to get the effect if you have *another* source for
    that particular ability equipped.  For example, if you have Throw L2
    (which grants Coin), then you would get HP Absorb applied to Coin only
    and not Throw, unless you *also* added a Throw L1 Materia to the
    character (which grants Throw only).
  When linked with Master Command, the Support Materia will apply its effect
    to *ALL* commands you currently have equipped, with the exception of
    Limit, Magic, W-Magic, Summon, W-Sum. and E.Skill.  Note that Throw is
    exempt unless you have another source for the Throw ability (since Master
    Command doesn't support Throw as a separate ability), but that Attack,
    Item, W-Item and all other additional commands are all able to gain the
    effects of the Support Materia.

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia, Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph, Deathblow,
  Manipulate, Mime, Master Command
Notes:
  MP Absorb will restore [Damage / 100] MP when the ability it is enhancing
    is used.  If the ability healed its target, then MP Absorb will hurt you
    instead.
  When linked to Magic and Summon Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to all abilities granted by that materia.  In the case of Magic
    Materia, this is dependent on the Magic Materia's current level.
  When linked with normal Command Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to the highlighted ability on the materia.  The darkened ability

    Limit, Magic, W-Magic, Summon, W-Sum. and E.Skill.  Note that Throw is
    exempt unless you have another source for the Throw ability (since Master
    Command doesn't support Throw as a separate ability), but that Attack,

HP:    -     Str:  -    Vit:  -    Dex:  -
MP:    -     Mag:  -    Spr:  -    Lck:  -

Lvl  Ability Gained                                      Total AP Req
 1   Use paired Magic with 4x-M once per battle          0
 2   Use paired Magic with 4x-M twice per battle         40000
 3   Use paired Magic with 4x-M three times per battle   80000
 4   Use paired Magic with 4x-M four times per battle    120000
 5   Use paired Magic with 4x-M five times per battle    200000

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia except Knights of Round
Notes:
  Any valid spell used with Quadra Magic will pick a random target out of the
    party chosen, and attempt to unleash all four castings against that
    target.  If the target dies during the castings, all unused castings are
    lost.
  Spells that are naturally area will simply hit the chosen party four times.
  Each casting will automatically have its damage cut in half; this includes
    HP% and Max HP%-based attacks like Demi and FullCure.  MP Cost will be as
    if only a single spell had been cast.
  Status effects without a 100% chance of hitting will also have their chance
    to hit cut in half.
  Quadra Magic will work with all abilities on the listed Materia above, with
    the exception of Escape and Knights of Round.
  Attaching multiple Quadra Magic to the same Materia will cause the spell to
    hit an extra time per Materia.  For example, having three Quadra Magics
    attached to three Earths would cause Quake to cast 6 times when used.
    This can be done up to a maximum of 8 times if you use five or more
    instances of Quadra Magic.
  In the event that the first spell is Reflected, the rest of the Quadra
    Magic hits will hit the target the spell was successfully reflected to,
    without needing to reflect again.

  The target chosen by the Sneak Attack will be random, based on the default
    target for the ability used
  Final Attack, Sneak Attack, Counter, Magic Counter and Counter Attack all
    share the same command space, and there are only room for 8 such attacks.
    Only the first eight Counter Effects placed chronologically onto a

  Final Attack allows the use of the chosen ability as a counter attack
    against an attack that knocks out the character.  The standard rules for
    counter attacks still apply however
  Final Attacks will hit either the enemy or allies, depending on the default
    target for the ability.  In the case of abilities that target enemies by
    default, a random group or single enemy will be chosen.  All supportive
    spells will be targetted on the character using the Final Attack (or that
    character's group if area)
  Final Attack, Sneak Attack, Counter, Magic Counter and Counter Attack all
    share the same command space, and there are only room for 8 such attacks.
    Only the first eight Counter Effects placed chronologically onto a

 2   --                                                  200000

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia, Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph, Deathblow,
  Manipulate, Mime, Master Command
Notes:
  Added Cut causes the Attack Command to be used on the same target as the
    affected ability immediately after its execution.
  If the ability was an area effect, a random target within the targetted
    group will be used.
  When linked to Magic and Summon Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to all abilities granted by that materia.  In the case of Magic
    Materia, this is dependent on the Magic Materia's current level.
  When linked with normal Command Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to the highlighted ability on the materia.  The darkened ability
    will only be allowed to get the effect if you have *another* source for
    that particular ability equipped.  For example, if you have Throw L2
    (which grants Coin), then you would get Added Cut applied to Coin only
    and not Throw, unless you *also* added a Throw L1 Materia to the
    character (which grants Throw only).
  When linked with Master Command, the Support Materia will apply its effect
    to *ALL* commands you currently have equipped, with the exception of
    Limit, Magic, W-Magic, Summon, W-Sum. and E.Skill.  Note that Throw is
    exempt unless you have another source for the Throw ability (since Master
    Command doesn't support Throw as a separate ability), but that Attack,
    Item, W-Item and all other additional commands are all able to gain the
    effects of the Support Materia.

Can be paired with:
  All Magic and Summon Materia, Steal, Sense, Throw, Morph, Deathblow,
  Manipulate, Mime, Master Command
Notes:
  Will use the standard Steal effect (as seen in the Enemy Mechanics Guide
    and in summarised form on the Steal and Mug Command below) on all targets
    that are successfully hit by the linked ability.
  When linked to Magic and Summon Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to all abilities granted by that materia.  In the case of Magic
    Materia, this is dependent on the Magic Materia's current level.
  When linked with normal Command Materia, the Support Materia will apply its
    effect to the highlighted ability on the materia.  The darkened ability
    will only be allowed to get the effect if you have *another* source for
    that particular ability equipped.  For example, if you have Throw L2
    (which grants Coin), then you would get Steal As Well applied to Coin
    only and not Throw, unless you *also* added a Throw L1 Materia to the
    character (which grants Throw only).
  When linked with Master Command, the Support Materia will apply its effect
    to *ALL* commands you currently have equipped, with the exception of
    Limit, Magic, W-Magic, Summon, W-Sum. and E.Skill.  Note that Throw is
    exempt unless you have another source for the Throw ability (since Master
    Command doesn't support Throw as a separate ability), but that Attack,
