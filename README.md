# Final Fantasy VII Emulator

The FF7 Emulator is a semi-realistic emulator of the battle mechanics of Final Fantasy VII. Graphics are minimal, implementation is partial.

## Author's Notes

I created this project specifically because I was disappointed that Aero3 was available
only to the enemy (specifically Rapps), feeling that several elementals were sorely
underrepresented in allied-methods of attack. As there was an Ice1, Fire1, Bolt1, Demi1,
Quake1, Bio1, I wanted there also to be an Aqua1 and Aero1, and at _least_ one attack 
other than summoning Alexander that would deal holy-based damage.

Anyway, this project has gone in a few wildly different directions, and I've become a 
better programmer since I started this incarnation of the project. But it is what it 
is, and it worked pretty well for a while (see "compare.JPG").
